[Optimization]
; should we load setting directly from this file with each shot or not
; loading parameters once on game load is possibly faster 
vDirectLoad=1

[General]
; constant parts of recoil - for vertical and horizontal movements
vVerticalIntensity=0.4

vHorizontalIntensity=0.01

; these are the minimum and maximum values for the movements
; note that the values are absolute and taken before any randomization for horizontal movements
vVerticalLowerLimit=0.6

vVerticalUpperLimit=4.4

vHorizontalLowerLimit=0.2

vHorizontalUpperLimit=3.4

; weapon damage and skill influence on recoil

vWeaponDamageCoeff=0.07

; weapon damage and skill influence on recoil - additional coefficient for horizontal movement due to excessive jiggle 

vWeaponDamageCoeffH=0.02

[Stats]
; strength influence on recoil - for vertical and horizontal movements
vStrengthCoeffV=0.5

vStrengthCoeffH=0.05

; weight influence on recoil - assuming that all weapons are front-heavy and weight makes them climb less
vWeightInfluenceV=0.3

; and shake more - this parameter makes horizontal movement greater and snappier
vWeightInfluenceH=0.02

;this switches ammo-based calculations (NAME-BASED, INACCURATE)

[Ironsights]
; the idea is, it's easier to control recoil in ironsights
vConstantCoefficient=0.1

; but it's also easier to master ironsights than hipfire
vIronsightsSkillBonus=20

; for ironsights all limits from [General] are multiplied by this
vIronsightsLimitsMultiplier=0.1

[Randomization]
; should we randomize horizontal movement? it's better to leave it this way for now
vIsRandomized=1

; how should z axis movement act - grow linearly like vertical movement, or randomly like horizontal 
vRotationAsVertical=1

;Vertical recoil multiplier for the first shot, can't be below 0
vFirstShotMultiplierV=0.5

;Horizontal recoil multiplier for the first shot, can't be below 0
vFirstShotMultiplierH=0.1

;this controls the length for the first shot
vFirstShotPeriod=10

;should we randomize it? Anything above 0 is "yes" and is a chance, anything above "0.9" is 90% chance
vFirstShotRandomization=0.0

[Individual]
; you can switch the whole feature off

; The new formula is in-line with individual recoil calculations
; if you want old (pre-v0.150) recoil formula, use this
