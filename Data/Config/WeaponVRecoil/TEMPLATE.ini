; first, let's define which way recoil goes 
X=-2
Y=3
; Z is rotation, use it carefully
Z=1
; now we have deviations - for randomization. All chances are 50\50
; positive and negative values do different things here
; for dX, positive is just randomization in one direction 
; so the result will be X*dX
dX=0.2
; dX=-0.2 - in this case this will be just randomization in both directions
; i.e. X*(+ or -)dX
dY=0.5
; for dY positive give you Y + dY
; but negative value will give you a chance to have Y = 0
; this is pseudo-"constant recoil" and can be used in low recoil weapons
dZ=0.1
; for dZ it works the same way, as in the main mod
; positive - mimics dY (so it will give you Z+dZ)
; negative - mimics dX (so it will give you Z*(+ or -)dZ) 
cIS=0.3
; this is a multiplier for all movements in ADS
; you can use it to define how comfortable the weapon is in ironsighting
