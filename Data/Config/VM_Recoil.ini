[Optimization]
; should we load setting directly from this file with each shot or not
; loading parameters once on game load is possibly faster 
vDirectLoad=1

[General]
; constant parts of recoil - for vertical and horizontal movements
vVerticalIntensity=0.2

vHorizontalIntensity=0.02

; these are the minimum and maximum values for the movements
; note that the values are absolute and taken before any randomization for horizontal movements
vVerticalLowerLimit=0.6

vVerticalUpperLimit=4.4

vHorizontalLowerLimit=0.2

vHorizontalUpperLimit=3.4

; weapon damage and skill influence on recoil

vWeaponDamageCoeff=0.5

; weapon damage and skill influence on recoil - additional coefficient for horizontal movement due to excessive jiggle 

vWeaponDamageCoeffH=0.5

[Ironsights]
; the idea is, it's easier to control recoil in ironsights
vConstantCoefficient=0.1

; but it's also easier to master ironsights than hipfire
vIronsightsSkillBonus=20

; for ironsights all limits from [General] are multiplied by this
vIronsightsLimitsMultiplier=0.2

[Stats]
; strength influence on recoil - for vertical and horizontal movements
vStrengthCoeffV=1

vStrengthCoeffH=0.5

; weight influence on recoil - assuming that all weapons are front-heavy and weight makes them climb less
vWeightInfluenceV=0.5

; and shake more - this parameter makes horizontal movement greater and snappier
vWeightInfluenceH=0.02

[Randomization]
; should we randomize horizontal movement? it's better to leave it this way for now
vIsRandomized=1

; how should z axis movement act - grow linearly like vertical movement, or randomly like horizontal 
vRotationAsVertical=1

[BUGFIXING]
; if the mod somehow doesn't work - try setting this to 0
vVATSfix=1
