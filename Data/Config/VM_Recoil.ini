[Optimization]
; should we load setting directly from this file with each shot or not
; loading parameters once on game load is possibly faster 
vDirectLoad=1

[General]

; constant parts of recoil - for vertical and horizontal movements
vVerticalIntensity=0.7

vHorizontalIntensity=0.1

; weapon damage and skill influence on recoil

vWeaponDamageCoeff=0.05

[Stats]
; strength influence on recoil - for vertical and horizontal movements
vStrengthCoeffV=1

vStrengthCoeffH=1

; weight influence on recoil - assuming that all weapons are front-heavy and weight makes them climb less
vWeightInfluenceV=0.1

; and shake more - this parameter makes horizontal movement greater and snappier
vWeightInfluenceH=0.1

[Randomization]

; should we randomize horizontal movement? it's better to leave it this way for now
vIsRandomized=1

; how should z axis movement act - grow linearly like vertical movement, or randomly like horizontal 
vRotationAsVertical=1
